## Note

This project is somewhat incomplete because `useActionState` is only available in React Canary as of July 2024. I didn't want to mess with the code base by updating the versions and later rewriting parts of it just to implement form validation. I could have used [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for it, but I was too lazy to squeeze in more time for it.
